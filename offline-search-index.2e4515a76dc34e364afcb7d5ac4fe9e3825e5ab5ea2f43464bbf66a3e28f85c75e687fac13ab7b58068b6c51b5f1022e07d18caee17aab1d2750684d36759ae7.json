[{"body":"Vortex Showcase is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for creating “showcases” based on your installed mods. Think of a showcase as a shareable report of your installed and enabled mods, perfect for either showing off your whole mod list or sharing a great set of related mods with others. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations Vortex Showcase is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet. Equally, this project is still in its infancy so there will likely be quite a few changes to how we do things. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Sharing your mod list: You can create a showcase based on your current mod list that will use all of your installed and enabled mods Game-agnostic: Currently, showcases don't have any game-specific logic so you should be able to create a showcase based on mods for any of your Vortex-managed games* Specific mod selections: You can also create a showcase based on only some selected mods if you just want to share a few mods that work well together.   * This does come with the caveat that (at this time) showcases also won't include any game-specific mod information, such as Gamebryo plugins, or load order information.\n If you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\nPurpose To be clear about this: this extension is not intended as a backup solution, modwat.ch replacement, or anything else like that. We cover this in the FAQ, but this is simply a way of creating decent-looking shareable mod lists from within Vortex.\n","excerpt":"Vortex Showcase is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":"There's two ways to create a showcase, depending on whether you want to use all of your enabled mods, or just some.\nTo create a showcase with all of your currently enabled mods, use the Create Showcase button in the top toolbar of the Mods screen. This will walk you through creating a showcase with any mods you have currently installed and enabled.\nTo create a showcase with only some selected mods, select all the mods you want to include from the Mods list (hold Ctrl key and click on each one) and use the Create Showcase button in the bottom action bar to create a showcase with just those mods.\n Once you've started your showcase, you'll be prompted for a name for your showcase (this can be anything you like) and what format you want your showcase in. Choose a format using the selections at the bottom of the dialog and click Create to start the showcase generation process. Once we've finished creating your showcase you'll see a notification appear and you can choose to copy the showcase to your clipboard or save it to a file on your PC.\n","excerpt":"There's two ways to create a showcase, depending on whether you want …","ref":"/docs/usage/showcase/","title":"Creating a Showcase"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with CnCRV and managing C\u0026C Remastered mods with Vortex.

You don't! This extension is specifically for people already using Vortex to manage your mods who want an easy way to share all or part of their mod setups. If you're currently using NMM/MO2/any other modding tool, this isn't for you!\nDoesn't Vortex already let you create mod reports? Yes, and they're amazing! But they're a troubleshooting measure, first and foremost. Every mod creates its own report, and they're very technical: listing individual files, plugins and deployment details. Showcases don't have any of that detail, but are much more human-readable. Different tools for different purposes!\nCan I use this to backup/restore my mods? No. Backup and restore of complex mod installations is a surprisingly hard problem, and it's not the problem that Showcase is trying to solve. As well as just being a very complicated thing to effectively backup, getting the level of detail required for reliable backup/restore requires a lot of game-specific logic that we just don't have here.\nYou can, however, create a showcase and use that to rebuild your mods from scratch if you want.\nWhy doesn't the showcase include plugins? The main reason is that the concept of plugins is very game-specific! What most people refer to as Plugins is the result of another (bundled) Vortex extension that handles plugins for Gamebryo games. Showcase deliberately tries to avoid game-specific features as much as possible.\nThe second reason is that Gamebryo plugins are complicated. Take a look at the extension above and you'll find about 6000 lines of code dedicated to reading and managing plugins for Gamebryo games. I just don't have the capacity to add that level of complexity to this extension.\nWhat about mods that aren't on the Nexus? They will still be included in your showcase, but they might not have quite as much information. A lot of the information that Vortex knows about a mod comes from Nexus Mods (or another metaserver for some games), and this extension just pulls mod metadata from what Vortex already knows about your mods.\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Installing the Extension To create showcases, you'll need to install the extension into Vortex first. There's a couple of different ways to do that, but unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Vortex Showcase and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named vortex-showcase with a handful of files inside, including at least the following:\n info.json index.js  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have files at the following location:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\\u003csome-other-files\u003e... With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the actions in your Mods screen.\n","excerpt":"Installing the Extension To create showcases, you'll need to install …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and managing C\u0026C Remastered mods with Vortex.
