# Vortex Showcase

> Find the full documentation at [showcase.vortex.support](https://showcase.vortex.support/)

Share your modding setups and build shareable mod lists directly from Vortex.

> This extension is still in preview, please report any issues you find! 

## What is it?

This is a simple extension that lets you create "showcases" to share mod lists. You can create a showcase from your entire behemoth of a mod list, or just select individual mods to share with your fellow modders.

There's plenty more information on what is and isn't available in [the docs](https://showcase.vortex.support), especially [the FAQ](https://showcase.vortex.support/docs/introduction/faq).

## How to use it?

You can install the extension either from the CI builds (click the Actions tab above), or by installing it directly from Vortex's Extensions pane. Restart Vortex and you should be good to go.

You can then create showcases based on either all of your enabled mods, or only a selection directly from your Mods list.

> Please report any bugs or issues you find as I have only been able to complete some basic (and limited) testing with this extension so far.
