[{"body":"Vortex Showcase is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for creating “showcases” based on your installed mods. Think of a showcase as a shareable report of your installed and enabled mods, perfect for either showing off your whole mod list or sharing a great set of related mods with others. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations Vortex Showcase is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet. Equally, this project is still in its infancy so there will likely be quite a few changes to how we do things. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Sharing your mod list: You can create a showcase based on your current mod list that will use all of your installed and enabled mods Game-agnostic: Currently, showcases don't have any game-specific logic so you should be able to create a showcase based on mods for any of your Vortex-managed games* Specific mod selections: You can also create a showcase based on only some selected mods if you just want to share a few mods that work well together.   * This does come with the caveat that (at this time) showcases also won't include any game-specific mod information, such as Gamebryo plugins, or load order information.\n If you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\nPurpose To be clear about this: this extension is not intended as a backup solution, modwat.ch replacement, or anything else like that. We cover this in the FAQ, but this is simply a way of creating decent-looking shareable mod lists from within Vortex.\n","excerpt":"Vortex Showcase is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and creating showcases with Vortex.

There's a couple of different ways to do that, but unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Vortex Showcase and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named vortex-showcase with a handful of files inside, including at least the following:\n info.json index.js  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have files at the following location:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-showcase\\\u003csome-other-files\u003e... With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the actions in your Mods screen.\n","excerpt":"Installing the Extension To create showcases, you'll need to install …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"There's two ways to create a showcase, depending on whether you want to use all of your enabled mods, or just some.\nTo create a showcase with all of your currently enabled mods, use the Create Showcase button in the top toolbar of the Mods screen. This will walk you through creating a showcase with any mods you have currently installed and enabled.\nTo create a showcase with only some selected mods, select all the mods you want to include from the Mods list (hold Ctrl key and click on each one) and use the Create Showcase button in the bottom action bar to create a showcase with just those mods.\n Once you've started your showcase, you'll be prompted for a name for your showcase (this can be anything you like) and what format you want your showcase in. Choose a format using the selections at the bottom of the dialog and click Create to start the showcase generation process. Once we've finished creating your showcase you'll see a notification appear and you can choose to copy the showcase to your clipboard or save it to a file on your PC.\n","excerpt":"There's two ways to create a showcase, depending on whether you want …","ref":"/docs/usage/showcase/","title":"Creating a Showcase"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with Vortex Showcase specifically.

You don't! This extension is specifically for people already using Vortex to manage your mods who want an easy way to share all or part of their mod setups. If you're currently using NMM/MO2/any other modding tool, this isn't for you!\nDoesn't Vortex already let you create mod reports? Yes, and they're amazing! But they're a troubleshooting measure, first and foremost. Every mod creates its own report, and they're very technical: listing individual files, plugins and deployment details. Showcases don't have any of that detail, but are much more human-readable. Different tools for different purposes!\nWhat games can I use this with? Any game you manage with Vortex should work! We pull the information on your mods directly from Vortex so any game that you're managing with Vortex, either built-in or through an extension, should work fine. If you find any problems that seem to only affect certain games, please raise an issue with as much information as you can.\nCan I use this to backup/restore my mods? No. Backup and restore of complex mod installations is a surprisingly hard problem, and it's not the problem that Showcase is trying to solve. As well as just being a very complicated thing to effectively backup, getting the level of detail required for reliable backup/restore requires a lot of game-specific logic that we just don't have here.\nYou can, however, create a showcase and use that to rebuild your mods from scratch if you want. You might also be interested in this other community extension.\nWhy doesn't the showcase include plugins? The main reason is that the concept of plugins is very game-specific! What most people refer to as Plugins is the result of another (bundled) Vortex extension that handles plugins for Gamebryo games. Showcase deliberately tries to avoid game-specific features as much as possible.\nThe second reason is that Gamebryo plugins are complicated. Take a look at the extension above and you'll find about 6000 lines of code dedicated to reading and managing plugins for Gamebryo games. I just don't have the capacity to add that level of complexity to this extension. I might try and add them at some point (given how ubiquitous the Gamebryo games are), but there'll have to be a bit of reverse engineering first.\nWhat about mods that aren't on the Nexus? They will still be included in your showcase, but they might not have quite as much information. A lot of the information that Vortex knows about a mod comes from Nexus Mods (or another metaserver for some games), and this extension just pulls mod metadata from what Vortex already knows about your mods.\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":"There's a handful of additional formats that most users won't need, but might still be useful. Rather than complicate the base installation, these are installable as a separate extension: Vortex Showcase - Extended Formats.\nYou can install this extension from Vortex just like the main extension, then create a showcase as usual and you will see the additional formats available to select. There's no additional steps to use these formats: just install the extension and create your showcase.\n","excerpt":"There's a handful of additional formats that most users won't need, …","ref":"/docs/usage/extended/","title":"Creating with Extended Formats"},{"body":"Showcase is fully open-source! You can see the full code for the extension (including these docs) on GitHub. Community contributions, fixes and PRs are all welcome! That being said, please read the info below to make all of our lives a bit easier.\nLicensing Vortex Showcase is made available under an MIT License. That means all contributions will also be licensed under the MIT License and all the conditions and limitations that involves.\nDevelopment Environment To work with the Showcase code, you'll only need Node.js (including a recent version of npm) and TypeScript installed. Development so far has been done in Visual Studio Code, but any IDE that supports TypeScript should work just fine.\n There's currently very little tsdoc included, this will hopefully change in a future release\n Getting set up Whether you are developing on the same machine that Vortex is installed on or not, the easiest way I have found to work with this has been to install the extension manually, then whenever I make a change simply drop my rebuilt index.js into the vortex-showcase folder and restart Vortex. Also remember to update the template files in your target environment if you make any changes.\nYou can find Diagnostics Logs in the overflow menu at the top right of the Vortex window. There is also a Vortex extension that lets you open the DevTools window.\nContinuous Integration Note that all commits to, and pull requests against, the master branch are automatically built as part of a GitHub Action. Please don't add unnecessary changes to the Actions workflow without prior discussion.\nFeature Requests Showcase is a community project, currently built and maintained by a single non-developer. As such, feature requests will be accepted, but I can't provide any level of assurance that any requests will certainly be included. Also remember that we are limited to features that Vortex can reasonably support. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss viability of any requests.\nI'd also like to maintain Showcase as game-independent as possible, so please don't open issues/PRs for very game-specific functionality. Ideally, I'll be extending the API that Showcase provides in future to allow for enhancing game-specific capabilities but this is a long way off.\nA note on confusing code For anyone who decides to wade into the Showcase code, there's a few things worth remembering:\n I'm not a developer: This is just something I'm doing in my spare time, so don't expect super-high-quality code. I'll happily take fixes, though! Working with Vortex is weird: There's quite a few quirks of the codebase that exist because of unfathomably mystifying behaviour in Vortex's extension API. The over-engineering is deliberate: This was as much of an exercise in my own JS/TS skills as anything else, so I've deliberately over-engineered the extension.

The complicated integration work of pulling mods and their metadata out of Vortex, as well as filtering out some stuff, is done by Showcase itself before the format renderers are called. For example, the default renderers take this model and use Mustache.js to render templates with that model and return the generated string content.\nAll showcase formats are loaded directly from Vortex's session state using the extension API, even the default ones. The Markdown and BBCode renderers are not hard-coded anywhere, they're just registered as formats when the extension loads.\n To see an example of how additional formats can be implemented and registered, check out the Extended Formats extension.\n Registering formats/renderers Registering a new format requires two things: an implementation of IShowcaseRenderer and a call to addShowcaseRenderer(key: string, () =\u003e IShowcaseRenderer).\nThe string key (i.e. Markdown) is what's shown to users so make sure it's reasonably friendly. The second parameter is a callback to return your renderer. If you need constructor params or any other weird setup, you should be safe-ish to do that here.\n Your renderer will be instantiated every time the showcase process is started, so don't do anything too heavy.\n For external extensions, you can register a renderer like so:\ncontext.requireExtension('Vortex Showcase'); context.once(() =\u003e { context.api.ext.addShowcaseAction('My Custom Action', () =\u003e new CustomAction()); context.api.ext.addShowcaseRenderer('My Custom Renderer', () =\u003e new CustomRenderer()); }); Rendering showcases When a user creates a showcase, they are prompted with all the currently registered renderers and can choose one. Once they hit Create, the extension will pull the IShowcaseRenderer with the matching key from session state and invoke it in two stages: model build and final rendering.\nFirst, to build the model metadata, the createModel function for the current renderer is called for each mod. If you don't need to do any customisation or control how mod metadata is created, then just return null, and the extension will populate sane defaults. You can also just change the model properties you care about and the model you return will be merged with the default.\nNext, once the template model has been built, the extension will call the createShowcase function passing in the generated model and the extension API (for convenience). This is where the actual rendering happens, and this function should return the final string contents of the showcase, which the user can then copy/save/take action on.\nOptional functions There's an extra function in a renderer to return a file name in createFileName based on the user-provided title. This is completely optional: if your method a) doesn't implement createFileName or b) returns null/undefined, Vortex will prompt the user for a file name and location. You can, however, use this step to manually specify a name (as the Markdown renderer does), or only return a file extension (i.e. return '*.csv') and Vortex will also prompt the user, but automatically use the right extension.\nIf your renderer only works with specific games, you can also implement the isEnabled(gameId: string) function, and your renderer will only be shown to the user if that function returns true for the currently managed game.\nActions Actions are (as the name suggests) any arbitrary action that a user might want to do with a generated showcase. Out of the box, this includes saving to a file and copying to the clipboard, but the action API is pretty open-ended: you can do basically anything.\nRegistering an action Much like registering a renderer, registering a custom action is just an implementation of IShowcaseAction and a call to addShowcaseAction.\nFor external extensions, you can register an action like so:\ncontext.requireExtension('Vortex Showcase'); context.once(() =\u003e { context.api.ext.addShowcaseAction('My Custom Action', () =\u003e new CustomAction()); }); The string key (i.e. My Custom Action) is what's shown to users so make sure it's reasonably friendly, and short. The second parameter is a callback to return your renderer. If you need constructor params or any other weird setup, you should be safe-ish to do that here.\nBuilding an action Much like renderers, custom actions are just an implementation of IShowcaseAction that Showcase will pull out of the session state and call after a showcase has been generated. After a showcase has been generated (i.e. the renderer has returned some output), Vortex will offer all the available actions to the user.\nThe main implementation of an action happens in the runAction(renderer: string, output: string) function, which will be called after the user has chosen that action (from the notification or dialog). The action will be passed the name of the renderer that generated the showcase (in case you need special handling for certain formats), and the raw output from the renderer (the output parameter). You can do pretty much anything in the runAction function: the ClipboardAction is a simple example of what you can do with actions, but you can do just about anything.\n You can optionally implement isEnabled if you only want your action to be available with certain renderers (or not certain renderers)\n ","excerpt":"The one advantage to Vortex Showcase's hilariously excessive …","ref":"/docs/developer/extensions/","title":"Extensions API"},{"body":" This release is now available on Nexus Mods.\n This release is a small feature update that adds new a new user setting to control your showcases a little better.
