This release is a minor fix update that squashes some bugs and improves internal logging. This includes:

- Errors when reading/parsing mod versions (thanks Tannin for [reporting this](https://github.com/agc93/vortex-showcase/issues/9))
- React warnings from the new Settings component (thanks @IDCs for [reporting this](https://github.com/agc93/vortex-showcase/issues/10))

You shouldn't see any obvious changes in this release, so make sure to check out all the release notes for [previous versions](/updates).

This version *requires* Vortex 1.3+, older Vortex versions can continue to use 0.0.4.

Extension authors might want to check the [developer docs](/docs/developer/extensions) for detail on the new extensions API.
