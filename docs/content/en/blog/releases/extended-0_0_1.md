This marks the first release of the Extended Formats package for Vortex Showcase. This extension (of an extension) adds a handful of extra formats to Vortex Showcase. 

This initial release adds three new formats to Showcase:

- CSV
- Discord
- Markdown Table

The CSV and Discord formats were removed from the main extension in the last update so this extension re-introduces them alongside the new more compact Markdown Table format.

This version *requires* Vortex 1.3+, older Vortex versions can continue to use 0.0.4. This extension requires Vortex Showcase 0.1+ to be installed (VOrtex will prompt you if it's not already installed).
