This release is a minor bugfix to change the style used for the BBCode format:

- There's no longer any `size` tags included, so showcases should now be more compatible with the Nexus Mods site
- Descriptions will no longer be HTML-escaped so there will be a lot less `&lt;br /&gt;` in your showcases ðŸ˜„ (but now there'll be a lot of `<br />` ðŸ˜¢)
- Missing version numbers are handled a little more gracefully than before

> Big thanks to @Pickysaurus for the help with BBCode/Nexus formatting!
