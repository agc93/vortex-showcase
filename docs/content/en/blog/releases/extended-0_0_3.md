This is a small bugfix release for the Extended Formats package for Vortex Showcase. 

This release fixes a small escaping bug in the Compact Markdown format and updates the extension's dependencies to match Vortex 1.4+ and Vortex Showcase 0.2+.

---

The CSV and Discord formats were removed from the main extension in a previous update so this extension re-introduces them alongside the new more compact Markdown Table format.

This version *requires* Vortex 1.3+, older Vortex versions can continue to use 0.0.4. This extension requires Vortex Showcase 0.1+ to be installed (Vortex will prompt you if it's not already installed).
