  Working with Showcase's documentation and how to contribute.

Ironically, the documentation side of the project has slightly higher environment requirements than the project itself! We're using the Hugo static site generator with the Docsy template, so you will need to have a recent version of Hugo Extended installed, as well as `npm` to restore the required tools.

Actual docs content is all stored in the `content/` directory, organised under language. At this time only English (`en`) is included, although translations are more than welcome!
