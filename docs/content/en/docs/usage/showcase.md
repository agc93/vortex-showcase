  How to generate a showcase for your mods in Vortex
---

There's two ways to create a showcase, depending on whether you want to use all of your enabled mods, or just some.

To create a showcase with all of your currently enabled mods, use the Create Showcase button in the top toolbar of the Mods screen. This will walk you through creating a showcase with any mods you have currently installed and enabled.

To create a showcase with only some selected mods, select all the mods you want to include from the Mods list (hold Ctrl key and click on each one) and use the *Create Showcase* button in the **bottom** action bar to create a showcase with just those mods.

Once you've started your showcase, you'll be prompted for a name for your showcase (this can be anything you like) and you can use the *Create ...* buttons on the dialog to create your showcase (defaults to Markdown). Once we've finished creating your showcase you'll see a notification appear and you can choose to copy the showcase to your clipboard or save it to a file on your PC.
