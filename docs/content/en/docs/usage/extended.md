  How to generate showcases using additional formats
---

There's a handful of additional formats that most users won't need, but might still be useful. Rather than complicate the base installation, these are installable as a separate extension: [*Vortex Showcase - Extended Formats*.](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/182)

You can install this extension from Vortex [just like the main extension](/docs/usage/installation), then [create a showcase](/docs/usage/showcase) as usual and you will see the additional formats available to select. There's no additional steps to use these formats: just install the extension and create your showcase.
